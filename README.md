# hello-world
Yet another repo. Nothing interesting to see here. These are not the files you're looking for. Move along.

For those of you who are immune to Jedi mind tricks, welcome to my first repository! I'm a longtime enthusiast and lurker who is looking to expand his skillset to include designing electronics and programming various computer systems. I have moderate experience in the IT/Telecommunications industry and have been a general nerd all my life, but I've recently committed myself to learn as much as I can and start giving back to the community at large. I hope to provide others with enjoyment and inspiration!

I will no doubt edit this readme in the future and add more minutia about myself. Stay tuned!
